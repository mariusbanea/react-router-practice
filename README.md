# React Router Practice

### To install the app run:
* npm install

### To start the app run:
* npm start

## The task:
* create a home, child, error and navigator stateless components
* edit the /src/App.js file to create a router to include an exact route, a normal route and an error one


## On success
* run npm start and using your browser navigate to http://localhost:3000/
* when you visit http://localhost:3000/ you will see the __"Home"__ component
* when you visit http://localhost:3000/child you will see the __"Child"__ component
* when you visit http://localhost:3000//grand-child/something you will see the __"GrandChild"__ component displaying a dynamic text ("something")
* when you visit http://localhost:3000/blah you will see the __"Error"__ component
* and the __"Navigation"__ component is visible in all 3 scenarios, containing the links to all the routes above
